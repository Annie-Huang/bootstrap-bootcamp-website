==========================================================================
If you use cdn, you cannot modify the files. If you want to use modified the files, you will need to download the scss files
under source files in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/

Layout breakpoint:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/
Breakpoint	Class infix	Dimensions
X-Small	None	<576px
Small	sm	≥576px
Medium	md	≥768px
Large	lg	≥992px
Extra large	xl	≥1200px
Extra extra large	xxl	≥1400px

navbar:
navbar-expand-lg: means in large device, it will expand to full length, otherwise, it will be hamburger menu.


ms-auto:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/#auto-margins
Auto margins -> Flexbox can do some pretty awesome things when you mix flex alignments with auto margins.
Shown below are three examples of controlling flex items via auto margins: default (no auto margin), pushing two
items to the right (.me-auto), and pushing two items to the left (.ms-auto).


Add hamburger icon:
<button
  class="navbar-toggler"
  type="button"
  data-bs-toggle="collapse"
  data-bs-target="#navmenu"
>
  <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
</button>

d-flex:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/#enable-flex-behaviors
Enable flex behaviors -> Apply display utilities to create a flexbox container and transform direct children elements
into flex items. Flex containers and items are able to be modified further with additional flex properties.


.img-fluid:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/images/#responsive-images
Responsive images -> Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with .img-fluid. This applies max-width: 100%;
and height: auto; to the image so that it scales with the parent element.

w-50:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/sizing/#relative-to-the-parent
Width and height utilities are generated from the utility API in _utilities.scss. Includes support for 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%,
and auto by default. Modify those values as you need to generate different utilities here.


text-sm-start: Start at the small breakpoint, align text at the start.

d-none: do not display.
d-sm-block: display block when it's sm size.
